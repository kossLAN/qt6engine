# qt6engine 

This is primarily a fork of [hyprqt6engine](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprqt6engine), and by extension [qt6ct](https://www.opencode.net/trialuser/qt6ct). This aims to seperate itself from unneeded dependencies, and to provide a good interface for nix.

## Installation


## Testing 
I primarily test with nix, enter the development shell and then `nix build`, alternatively typical cmake build and install, or for convenience the Justfile.
